## About the Project
This React project is a playground for experimenting with:
- Component-based architecture.
- Styling with CSS frameworks (e.g., Tailwind CSS) or custom styles.
- State management with hooks (useState, useEffect).
- Responsive design and layout techniques.

The project doesn't serve a specific purpose but provides a foundation to build and explore frontend concepts.

   ```
3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

### Running the Project Locally
1. **Start the Development Server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```
2. **Open in Browser**:
   After starting the server, open your browser and navigate to the URL displayed in the terminal, typically `http://localhost:5173/`.

3. **Make Changes and Explore**:
